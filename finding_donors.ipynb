    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "1- AdaBoost (focuses on classification problems and aims to convert a set of weak classifiers into a strong one)\n",
    "-- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\n",
    "adaBoost can be used to solve many real world problems such as customer churn prediction (https://www.cs.rit.edu/~rlaz/PatternRecognition/slides/churn_adaboost.pdf) where the algoritm can predict if the customer is going to churn or not. AdaBoost algorithms make a good performance in predicting the customer churn. They can not only determine a probability for a prediction with its likelihood, but also explicitly indicate the potential rules of the classification process.\n",
    "\n",
    "-- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "It is a powerful classification algorithm and its strengths are (1) AdaBoost algorithm will select the weak classifier that works best at that round of boosting. (2) Weak classifier might work best to solve given classification problem. (3) Can achieve similar classification results with much less tweaking of parameters. It performes best on both classification and regression problems. (http://www.nickgillian.com/wiki/pmwiki.php/GRT/AdaBoost)\n",
    "\n",
    "-- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "(1) Can be sensitive to noisy data and outliers. (2)  It can be less susceptible to the overfitting problem than most learning algorithms. (http://www.nickgillian.com/wiki/pmwiki.php/GRT/AdaBoost)\n",
    "\n",
    "-- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "AdaBoost is relatively easy to implement and can be applied to variety of classification algorithms to improve performance. Therefore, i choose to use it to determine weak models that can arise from target and individual features where there could be strong correlations.\n",
    "(https://hackernoon.com/under-the-hood-of-adaboost-8eb499d78eab)\n",
    "\n",
    "2- Logistic Regression: \n",
    "-- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied?\n",
    "Real world example would be, Marketing: Predicting if a given user will buy an insurance product or not. Another example would be, Banking: Predicting if a customer will default on a loan. (https://www.machinelearningplus.com/machine-learning/logistic-regression-tutorial-examples-r/)\n",
    "\n",
    "-- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "It can best used as a performance baseline and it is used for binary classification (categorical).  It is easy to implement and very efficient to train. \n",
    "It performs well when removing attributes that are unrelated to the output variable as well as variables that are much correlated to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "-- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "It cannot be used to solve non-linear problems as its decision surface is linear also it depends very highly on a proper presentation of data where all the important independent variables have been identified.\n",
    "It performs poorly when dealing with continuous outcomes For example; it could not be used to determine how high a patient's fever will rise, because the scale of temperature is continuous.\n",
    "\n",
    "-- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "In this problem, we want to determine income below or above 50k also, it is a very good model to use as performance baseline.\n",
    "(https://machinelearning-blog.com/2018/04/23/logistic-regression-101/)\n",
    "\n",
    "3- Support Vector Machines (SVM):\n",
    "-- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\n",
    "It is used for classification and regression analysis. \n",
    "Real world applications include:\n",
    " --> Face detection – SVMc classify parts of the image as a face and non-face and create a square boundary around the face. It contains training data of n x n pixels with a two-class face (+1) and non-face (-1).\n",
    " \n",
    " --> Text and hypertext categorization – SVMs allow Text and hypertext categorization for both inductive and transductive models. They use training data to classify documents into different categories. It categorizes based on the score generated and then compares with the threshold value.\n",
    " (https://data-flair.training/blogs/applications-of-svm/)\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "-- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "Strengths: (1) training is relatively easy. (2) No local optimal, unlike in neural networks. (3) It scales relatively well to high dimensional data and the trade-off between classifier complexity and error can be controlled explicitly. \n",
    "It performs well with non-linear classification using the kernel trick.\n",
    "\n",
    "-- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "Weakness:  needs a good kernel function or choice of the kernel. (2) Speed and size limitation both in training and testing. (3) When using large amount of features plotting can take ling time as SVM uses n-dimensional space.\n",
    "(https://data-flair.training/blogs/svm-support-vector-machine-tutorial/)\n",
    "\n",
    "-- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "SVM best classify the data and find the best possible boundary as it works in multiple dimensions where each dimension of which represents a \"feature\" of a particular object and that is a great advantage in solving this problem.\n"

    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, each weak learner can split the data in a single line, for the first time there could be misclassified data, which is fine as the next learner will avoid them and might make another miscalssified data which also will avoided by the next learner. Therefore this proccess will be  reapeated until a certin point then we combine them by adding all mistakes made by the learners. the model that has a negative number will represent (D_no) and positive number (d_yes) after that the learners will vote where the splitted data should be placed."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
